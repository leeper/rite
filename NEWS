# CHANGES to rite 0.4 #

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##
* The "File" menu now allows users to open an additional `rite` window that uses the same options as the original `rite` call. (#62)
* The "Run" menu now includes an option to turn off the printing of the prompt '>' and continuation prompt '+' symbols, thus making it easier to copy output (ala the knitr default output). (#80)
* When attempting to run `Sweave`, if a Sweave.sty file is not available, one is copied from the R home directory to the directory containing the .Rnw file. (#79)
* The "Run" menu now includes an option to "Tidy R Script", calling the **formatR** package on the open script. (#78)
* The "File" menu allows users to load the history directly into R as a new script. (#75)
* The "Run" menu now includes an option "Add commands to history?" (`TRUE` by default) to add executed commands to the R command history. (#73)
* Multiple warning dialogs in the same "Run" execution can now be suppressed via the warning dialog. Warning dialogs can also be turned off entirely using the "Wait on warnings?" option on the "Run" menu. (#74)
* Added ability to load a remote URL as initial script using new argument `url`. (#68)
* Changed default tab setting from "\t" to "    " (4 spaces).
* Added ability to upload HTML or automatically rendered (R)markdown to [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) using `markdown::rpubsUpload`. (#71)

## BUG FIXES ##
* Sometimes in January 2014, `tcltk2::ctext` started producing a catastrophic error of the form `Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTclObjv, objv), class = "tclObj"): [tcl] unknown color name "".` In response, `rite` now creates the "ctext" object directly rather than through its **tcltk2** wrapper.

# CHANGES to rite 0.3 #

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##
* From v0.2.56, multi-file gists can now be opened one file at a time.
* From v0.2.54, reports can now be generated from the standard `rite` editor, not just from `riteout`.
* The rite output and error widgets now have editing enabled.
* A checkbox on the Report Generation menu now controls whether PDF and HTML output files are opened after report generation. (#47)
* Attempting to open or append a multi-file Gist will cause only the first file to be opened and result in a warning.
* Added support for bracket-completion highlighting. The tk ctext widget already highlighted when brackets were originally righthand closed, but now brackets are highlighted when typed or traversed. (#20)
* Open script and include script commands now use the ctext widget's `fastinsert` command to improve load times (without immediately highlighting script contents).
* From v0.2.41, the `echo` parameter now defaults to `TRUE`.
* The value of `tab` can now be used to specify the amount of space inserted when pressing `<TAB>`. See documentation.
* Added the ability to load/append/reference a remote file either via printing a `source` call or a multi-line command using **RCurl** and `source`.
* Added support for loading from and (anonymously) saving to Github gists.
* Added support for the **knitr** functions `stitch` and `spin`, as well as markdown conversion to the Report Generation menu; reorganized the menu accordingly.
* A new function `riteout` provides a shorter name wrapper for `rite(catchOutput=TRUE)`.
* A new function function `sinkstart` provides an experimental tk widget for displaying color-coded R output. The sink can be toggled using `sinkstop` (to keep the widget open but pause the sink) or closed entirely by exiting the widget.
* Default syntax highlighting now includes only `"r"` rather than `c("r","latex")` as in **rite** (<=0.2).
* Added preliminary syntax highlighting support for xml/html tags and comments, rnw in-line code chunks, rtex code chunks, brew, reST, roxygen, and markdown code chunks.
* Support for "objects" operations found on the RGui Misc menu have been added to the Run menu.
* Added support for `toupper` and `tolower` to the context menu.
* Added support for option `autosave` to automatically save the script. See documentation.

## BUG FIXES ##
* Updated imports of Github Gists to correctly retrieve file content from raw URLs. (#60)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the command completion context menu from destroying on Ubuntu. The menu can be closed with a right-button mouse click. (#53)
* Fixed bug in SaveAs that was not appending file extensions. (#48)
* Several bugs - related to handling of periods and other naming irregularities - were corrected in the handling of F2 command completion and F1 help functions.
* New versions of libcurl (>7.28) deprecate boolean values for options (e.g., SSL_VERIFYPEER and SSL_FOLLOWLOCATION). This has been updated. Everything is backwards compatible to earlier versions of libcurl.
* Changed the underlying scripting function from an `eval(parse(text=...))` construction to `source` to provide a more robust scripting tool that also allows for a more console-like output (when not in `riteout`).
* Fixed error on package load with `library` and added support for automatic syntax highlighting when packages are loaded with `require`.
* Interrupting the printing of output caused rite to hang indefinitely. Printing can now be interrupted from the console/terminal.
* Selecting "Quit R" from the rite File menu did not prompt to save an unsaved script or output.


# CHANGES TO rite 0.2 #

* **rite** 0.1 was apparently incompatible, for a number of reasons, with non-Windows operating systems. Thanks to significant feedback from Yihue Xie, **rite** 0.2 is now compatible with UNIX-like platforms.

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##

* Report generation tools, previously listed under the Output menu, have been moved to a separate Report Generation menu (only available when `catchOutput=TRUE`). Several additional tools were also added. See documentation.
* Added greater control over colors of syntax highlighting through a new `color` parameter to `rite`.

## BUG FIXES ##

* Removed references to `tkwm.bitmap`, which was causing a critical failure on linux. (h/t Yihue Xie)
* Removed a Windows-specific call to `bringToTop` that was preventing loading on other platforms. (h/t Yihue Xie)
* Modified syntax highlighting code to prevent errors of the form:
>`Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTcl, ...), class = "tclObj") : [tcl] missing close-bracket.` when rite was initialized. Specifically, modified syntax highlighting procedure to handle function names that include punctuation.(h/t Yihue Xie)
* Fixed a bug in cut ("<Ctrl-x>" or from the context menu) that was copying but not deleting selected text.
* Fixed a typo that prevented the addition of new syntax highlighting when packages were loaded from the script editor.
* Changed `tk2panedwindow` (from **tcltk2**) to ttkpanedwindow (from **tcltk**).
