### CHANGES TO rite 0.2 ###

* rite 0.1 was apparently incompatible, for a number of reasons, with non-Windows operating systems. Thanks to significant feedback from Yihue Xie (Iowa State University), rite 0.2 is now compatible with UNIX-like platforms.

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##

* Report generation tools, previously listed under the Output menu, have been moved to a separate Report Generation menu (only available when `catchOutput=TRUE`). Several additional tools were also added. See documentation.
* Added greater control over colors of syntax highlighting through a new `color` parameter to `rite`.

## BUG FIXES ##

* Removed references to tkwm.bitmap, which was causing a critical failure on linux. (h/t Yihue Xie)
* Removed a Windows-specific call to `bringToTop` that was preventing loading on other platforms. (h/t Yihue Xie)
* Modified syntax highlighting code to prevent errors of the form `Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTcl, ...), class = "tclObj") : [tcl] missing close-bracket.` when rite was initialized. Specifically, modified syntax highlighting procedure to handle function names that include punctuation.(h/t Yihue Xie)
* Fixed a bug in cut (<Ctrl-x> or from the context menu) that was copying but not deleting selected text.
* Fixed a typo that prevented the addition of new syntax highlighting when packages were loaded from the script editor.
* Changed tk2panedwindow (from tcltk2) to ttkpanedwindow (from tcltk).
