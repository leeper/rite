# CHANGES to rite 0.3 #

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##
* Added the ability to load/append/reference a remote file either via printing a `source` call or a multi-line command using **RCurl** and `source`.
* Added support for loading from and (anonymously) saving to Github gists.
* Added support for the **knitr** functions `stitch` and `spin`, as well as markdown conversion to the Report Generation menu; reorganized the menu accordingly.
* A new function `riteout` provides a shorter name wrapper for `rite(catchOutput=TRUE)`.
* A new function `ritesink` provides an experimental (and primitive) tk widget for displaying color-coded R output.
* Default syntax highlighting now includes only `"r"` rather than `c("r","latex")` as in **rite** (<=0.2).
* Added preliminary syntax highlighting support for xml/html tags and comments, rnw in-line code chunks, rtex code chunks, brew, reST, roxygen, and markdown code chunks.
* Support for "objects" operations found on the RGui Misc menu have been added to the Run menu.
* Added support for `toupper` and `tolower` to the context menu.
* Added support for option `autosave` to automatically save the script. See documentation.

## BUG FIXES ##
* Fixed error on package load with `library` and added support for automatic syntax highlighting when packages are loaded with `require`.
* Interrupting the printing of output caused rite to hang indefinitely. Printing can now be interrupted from the console/terminal.
* Selecting "Quit R" from the rite File menu did not prompt to save an unsaved script or output.


# CHANGES TO rite 0.2 #

* **rite** 0.1 was apparently incompatible, for a number of reasons, with non-Windows operating systems. Thanks to significant feedback from Yihue Xie, **rite** 0.2 is now compatible with UNIX-like platforms.

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##

* Report generation tools, previously listed under the Output menu, have been moved to a separate Report Generation menu (only available when `catchOutput=TRUE`). Several additional tools were also added. See documentation.
* Added greater control over colors of syntax highlighting through a new `color` parameter to `rite`.

## BUG FIXES ##

* Removed references to `tkwm.bitmap`, which was causing a critical failure on linux. (h/t Yihue Xie)
* Removed a Windows-specific call to `bringToTop` that was preventing loading on other platforms. (h/t Yihue Xie)
* Modified syntax highlighting code to prevent errors of the form:
>`Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTcl, ...), class = "tclObj") : [tcl] missing close-bracket.` when rite was initialized. Specifically, modified syntax highlighting procedure to handle function names that include punctuation.(h/t Yihue Xie)
* Fixed a bug in cut ("<Ctrl-x>" or from the context menu) that was copying but not deleting selected text.
* Fixed a typo that prevented the addition of new syntax highlighting when packages were loaded from the script editor.
* Changed `tk2panedwindow` (from **tcltk2**) to ttkpanedwindow (from **tcltk**).
